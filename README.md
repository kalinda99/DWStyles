# DreamWidgets
A Firefox (Chrome will be supported later) browser extension to make Deamwidth.org better, similar to new xkit for Tumblr. This is primarily aimed at roleplayers, it's also meant to make using DW on mobile easier.

This is very much WIP and alpha, I just started writing it. I'm also pretty new to coding so some of this can probably be done better and it should improve over time. Below is a list of implemented features. See the TODO for planned features.

- Responsive icon browser (paid accounts only) that works well on mobile.
- Dark theme for Lynx and Tropo Red.
- Better thread view for mobile
- User created bookmarks that are easily accessible on every page

I'd like to give a HUGE, HUGE thanks to [Anathomical](https://github.com/anathomical) and [Pytho](https://pytho.carrd.co/) for all the help and advice they've given me on this project. Thanks for helping me learn, guys! <3
