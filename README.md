# Dreamwidth Toolbox
An extension to make Deamwidth.org better, similar to new xkit for Tumblr. This is primarily aimed at roleplayers, it's also meant to make using DW on mobile easier.

This is very much WIP and alpha, I just started writing it. A list of current and planned features are coming soon.
