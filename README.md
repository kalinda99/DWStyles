# DreamWidgets
A Firefox/Chrome (and Chromium-based) browser extension to make Deamwidth.org better, similar to new xkit for Tumblr. This is primarily aimed at roleplayers, it's also meant to make using DW on mobile easier.

This is very much WIP and alpha, I just started writing it. Below is a list of implemented features. See the TODO for planned features.

- Responsive icon browser (paid accounts only) that works well on mobile.
- Dark theme for Lynx and Tropo Red.
