# TODO
In no particular order...
- Import/export settings
- Allow favourites to be specific to each journal
- Allow user to customize postions and look of menus
- Allow user to use their own custom CSS for journal pages, etc.
- Batch icon upload (huge maybe here)
- Quick keywords: easy way to set a pattern of keywords/comments on multiple icons
- Add small icon size toggle in icon browser
